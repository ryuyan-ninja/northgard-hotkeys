# Northgard - Building/Unit Hotkeys

As a StarCraft player, I couldn't stand to play this game without hotkeys, so I created this.

## Layout

The hotkeys tend to be laid out in a grid, similar to games like Age of Empires.

[Hotkey Reference Guide](hotkey_reference.md)

## Usage

Download the .exe from the latest release [here](https://github.com/ryuyan-ninja/northgard-hotkeys/releases) and run it as an administrator. Administrative rights are necessary to give the script the ability to interact with the game window. 

As this tool is made with [AutoHotkey](https://www.autohotkey.com), if you have it installed, you can alternatively download the source scripts and run them manually, but you will also need to run them as administrator. If you wish to do that, download all of the scripts [here](https://github.com/ryuyan-ninja/northgard-hotkeys/archive/master.zip), extract them wherever you like, and then run `northgard-hotkeys.ahk`.

While the script is running, there will be an H icon on your taskbar. You can right-click on this and hit Exit to close the script.

## Donations

I created this tool to make the game more enjoyable for myself, but I put in considerable effort into ensuring this is accessible to all. If you found this useful, send a few dollars my way, if you like!
